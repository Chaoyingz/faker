# First year resume

One year past since we took over the maintenance of Faker. Many things have changed since then, but still more to come.

We release two major versions and currently working already on the next major version v8. You can already try out an alpha version by installing [@faker-js/faker@8.0.0-alpha.0](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@faker-js/faker/v/8.0.0-alpha.0).

## Trends and stats

One of the most interesting trends is that we still didn't pass the download count of the original package.

This means that in total there are still projects out there that hasn't migrated and additionally many new users got attracted to use our package.
If you are still using the original package, please consider migrating to our package. We have many improvements and bug fixes that you are missing out on.
